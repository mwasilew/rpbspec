IoT Reference Platform
======================

IoT Reference Platform does not include *common*/*kernel* section.

Hardware
--------
The hardware that the IoT Reference Platform runs on *should* be 96Boards compliant. The following requirements assume that software runs on 96Boards IoT compliant hardware.

Zephyr
------
Zephyr Project is a small, scalable real-time operating system for use on resource-constrained systems supporting multiple architectures.  Developers are able to tailor their optimal solution. As a true open source project, the community can evolve the Zephyr Project to support new hardware, developer tools, sensor and device drivers.  Advancements in security, device management capabilities, connectivity stacks and file systems can be easily implemented.

MyNewt
------
Apache Mynewt is a real-time, modular operating system for connected IoT devices that need to operate for long periods of time under power, memory, and storage constraints. The first connectivity stack offered is BLE 4.2.

The IoT Reference Platform *shall* provide a open-source bootloader that implements a dual-bank architecture enabling active and passive application execution.  

OTA updates
-----------
The IoT Reference Platform *shall* provide a reference/sample implementation enabling a secure, OTA (over-the-air) update.  When running the reference application enabling OTA, the application *shall* regularly check with the IoT sw provisioning server, i.e. Hawkbit, over HTTP to determine if there is an image updated available for deployment.  The OTA update *shall* load software onto the currently passive partition and the device will reboot.  If the deployment is corrupt or incomplete, the device *shall* boot from the original partition.

The device shall communicate via bluetooth to an IoT gateway that has a route to the Hawkbit server.  

SDK
---
The IoT Reference Platform *shall* provide all of the necessary tools and environment with appropriate documentation describing, in detail, how to rebuild and use the IoT Reference Platform components.
